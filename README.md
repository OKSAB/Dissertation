# Dissertation

## Project Overview

The Dissertation project is focused on developing a specialized large language model (LLM) that enables users to inquire about diseases and receive personalized recommendations for natural, holistic cures. By fine-tuning the [ChatDoctor](https://huggingface.co/zl111/ChatDoctor) API, the model aims to provide beneficial remedies for various pains and illnesses while avoiding conventional medical/chemical antibiotics or cures. The core objectives include:

- **Empowering Users:** Deliver accessible, natural treatment options based on user symptoms.
- **Holistic Healthcare:** Promote the exploration of non-chemical, holistic remedies.
- **Advanced NLP Integration:** Leverage a fine-tuned LLM to understand and interpret healthcare inquiries accurately.
